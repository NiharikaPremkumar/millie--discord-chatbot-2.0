# Millie:  Enhanced Discord Server Bot with Google's Gemini Integration

## Overview

This project is an enhanced version of a basic Discord server bot, now integrated with Google's Gemini to provide more dynamic and context-aware responses. The bot automates interactions and offers instant answers to frequently asked questions or common statements within a Discord server.

## Features

- **Predefined Responses**: The bot replies with predefined responses when it detects specific keywords or phrases in the server chat.
- **Dynamic Responses with Google's Gemini**: Uses Google's Gemini for more intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and easy to customize responses.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, ensuring smooth performance even in larger servers.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-server-bot.git
   cd discord-server-bot
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the bot**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your bot token and Gemini API key:
     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
     GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
     ```

4. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Scope

While this bot currently handles predefined and dynamic responses effectively, there are several enhancements that can be implemented to make it more robust and versatile:

1. **Advanced Command Handling**: Expand functionality to include more complex command handling, enabling users to execute various commands for different functionalities.
2. **Database Integration**: Store user interactions and preferences in a database for personalized responses and improved interaction tracking.
3. **Moderation Features**: Add capabilities to help with server moderation, such as auto-muting, kicking, or banning users based on predefined rules.
4. **Customizable Prefixes**: Allow server administrators to set custom prefixes for commands, making the bot more adaptable to different server environments.
